Note : Pour le cours CSC 1105 Full Stack  Web Design, il faudra aussi TypeScript comme prérequis & Pour le cours Web Services CSC 1203, il faudra aussi dispenser Java qui est un prérequis (ou on introduira simplement les bases du langage pour développer avec Spring Boot) d’où je n’ai pu vraiment établir une description correct. Un éclaircissement m’aidera bien.
Aussi je n’ai pas tenu compte des Credit Hours, Programming Concepts, Software include et Website include, ça sera plus facile de le remplir lorsque nous aurons fini avec nos leçon.
Concernant le cours sur la partie sql, je crois que j’ai dû supprimer le mail par mégarde.
